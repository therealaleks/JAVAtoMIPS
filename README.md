# JAVAtoMIPS
This is web app is a versatile "decompiler"of sorts which lets the user write Java code using a few select classes to then translates it into MIPS code fit to run on MARS. The front-end UI is currently unfinished. 

The (work in progress) web client (written in HTML/CSS/Javascript) can be found inside client.zip
